    This function should take a single string and return a dictionary

    For example::

    It's fine to consider punctuation part of a word (e.g., a comma
    at the end of a word can be counted as part of that word) and
    to consider differently-capitalized words as different::

def translate_to_pirate_talk(phrase):
    """Translate phrase to pirate talk.

    Given a phrase, translate each word to the Pirate-speak

    should pass through unchanged. Return the resulting sentence.

    Here's a table of English to Pirate translations:

    ----------  ----------------
    English     Pirate
    ----------  ----------------
    sir         matey
    hotel       fleabag inn
    student     swabbie
    man         matey
    professor   foul blaggart
    restaurant  galley
    your        yer
    excuse      arr
    students    swabbies
    are         be
    restroom    head
    my          me
    is          be
    ----------  ----------------

    For example::

        >>> translate_to_pirate_talk("my student is not a man")
        'me swabbie be not a matey'

    You should treat words with punctuation as if they were different
    words::

def kids_game(names):
    """Play a kids' word chain game.

    Given a list of names, like::

      bagon baltoy yamask starly nosepass kalob nicky

    Do the following:

    1. Always start with the first word ("bagon", in this example).

    2. Add it to the results.

    3. Use the last letter of that word to look for the next word.
       Since "bagon" ends with n, find the *first* word starting
       with "n" in our list --- in this case, "nosepass".

    4. Add "nosepass" to the results, and continue. Once a word has
       been used, it can't be used again --- so we'll never get to
       use "bagon" or "nosepass" a second time.

    5. When you can't find an unused word to use, you're done!
       Return the list of output words.

    For example::

        >>> kids_game(["bagon", "baltoy", "yamask", "starly",
        ...            "nosepass", "kalob", "nicky", "booger"])
        ['bagon', 'nosepass', 'starly', 'yamask', 'kalob', 'baltoy']

    (After "baltoy", there are no more y-words, so we end, even
    though "nicky" and "booger" weren't used.)

    Two more examples:

        >>> kids_game(["apple", "berry", "cherry"])
        ['apple']

        >>> kids_game(["noon", "naan", "nun"])
        ['noon', 'naan', 'nun']

    This is a tricky problem. In particular, think about how using
    a dictionary (with the super-fast lookup they provide) can help;
    good solutions here will definitely require a dictionary.
